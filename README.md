# Impulsed Membrane Response
*A Purdue SURF 2024 project*

README added by Adam; probably good to have this here. 

**Carolyn**: Please update as you see fit! A description, but also a 
section describing how to run the code may also be good for future 
use.

## Adam's Note on Impulse "Handling"

See the file `adam-note_impulses_2024-06-28.txt` for some thoughts on
how impulses are handled.

I'd suggest focusing on implementing the impulse handling for a
single spatial mode coefficient (e.g., w_11) and plotting it's value
over time, to make sure that's being handled properly. Then once
that's working, move back to plotting the whole membrane response.
