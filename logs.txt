current agenda items:

- plotting just phi_1_1
- plotting just w_1_1, w_1_2

- have plots of membrane displacement along a cutout
- have plots of average displacement over time, and should have plots of 
  just displacement some displacement modes over time (w_1_1, w_1_2)..
  ... once i finish debugging why plots look weird, that is..
  - concerned that plotting looks like just a positive response, and not some sort of sine wave

- plots should be able to be saved to image png files
 (these files will be created upon running the script)

- other to-dos i'm working on: starting to piece together a final report LaTeX draft, due next fri
