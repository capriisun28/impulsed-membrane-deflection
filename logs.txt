current agenda items:

- plotting just w_1_1, w_1_2 (debugging the plotting errors)
- fix color bars for membrane response
- make slides with plots (don't forget slide numbers!, nice words, etc)
- brief synopsis (high level)
- piecing together a final report LaTeX draft, due next fri, share with adam, tom
- start thinking about poster presentation
- debug: no longer showing displacement v time graphs when running script hmm
- update github readme
- have my loop be refector into a fn w a temporal response that returns the amplitude of the displacement
- modulate everything so my script isnt so crowded (main file where i call the response fn over time and all the plots)- have my loo
- plot just w_1_1


things that have been done:

- plotting just phi_1_1
- have plots of membrane displacement along a cutout
- have plots of average displacement over time
- plots are now saved to image png files
 (these files will be created upon running the script)
