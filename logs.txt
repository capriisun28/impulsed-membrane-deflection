current agenda items:

high priority:
- debug: plots not showing again
-   plotting just individual modes still weird (plot_individual_modes)
- fix color bars for membrane response
    - eventually to keep the color scale the same just find max and mins and pass it in as key value pairs
- finish as much as possible about final report draft about what sims can do once done debugging
    - share w adam and tom
- start thinking about poster presentation
- refactor code into multiple modules
- update abstract, turn in final draft
- wmn as 3d array 
- test cases: we know the response should look like a damped harmonic oscillator
- most citations in model

lower priority:
- brief synopsis (high level)
- make slides with plots (don't forget slide numbers!, nice words, etc)
- start thinking about poster presentation
- for displacement against cutout fix key so displaying times correctly
- clarify question, repeated here (also commented on line 44 of model.py): 
    - for defining h for a membrane_response object (a membrane): 
    ... something that is still confusing to me is that we are treating this and plotting it like a 2D membrane, 
    ... but we also give it a height so as to define tension as such?


things that have been done:
- updated github readme
- implemented proper velocity jump condition checking (hopefully it is accurate)
- motivation section for final report draft
- plotting just phi_1_1
- have plots of membrane displacement along a cutout
- have plots of average displacement over time
- plots are now saved to image png files
 (these files will be created upon running the script)
